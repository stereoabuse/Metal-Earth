Of Aule and Yavanna 

It is told that in their beginning the Dwarves were made 
by Aule in the darkness of Middle-earth; for so greatly did 
Aule desire the coming of the Children, to have learners to 
whom he could teach his lore and his crafts, that he was 
unwilling to await the fulfilment of the designs of lluvatar. 
And Aule made the Dwarves even as they still are, because 
the forms of the Children who were to come were unclear to 
his mind, and because the power of Melkor was yet over 
the Earth; and he wished therefore that they should be 
strong and unyielding. But fearing that the other Valar might 
blame his work, he wrought in secret: and he made first the 
Seven Fathers of the Dwarves in a hall under the mountains 
in Middle-earth. 

Now lluvatar knew what was done, and in the very hour 
that Aule's work was complete, and he was pleased, and 
began to instruct the Dwarves in the speech that he had 
devised for them, lluvatar spoke to him; and Aule heard his 
voice and was silent. And the voice of lluvatar said to him: 
'Why hast thou done this? Why dost thou attempt a thing 
which thou knowest is beyond thy power and thy authority? 
For thou hast from me as a gift thy own bring only, and no 
more; and therefore the creatures of thy hand and mind can 
live only by that being, moving when thou thinkest to move 
them, and if thy thought be elsewhere, standing idle. Is that 
thy desire?' 

Then Aule answered: 'I did not desire such lordship. I 
desired things other than I am, to love and to teach them, so 
that they too might perceive the beauty of Ea, which thou 
hast caused to be. For it seemed to me that there is great 
room in Arda for many things that might rejoice in it, yet it is 
for the most part empty still, and dumb. And in my 
impatience I have fallen into folly. Yet the making of thing is 
in my heart from my own making by thee; and the child of 
little understanding that makes a play of the deeds of his 
father may do so without thought of mockery, but because 
he is the son of his father. But what shall I do now, so that 
thou be not angry with me for ever? As a child to his father, I 
offer to thee these things, the work of the hands which thou 



hast made. Do with them what thou wilt. But should I not 
rather destroy the work of my presumption?' 

Then Aule took up a great hammer to smite the 
Dwarves; and he wept. But lluvatar had compassion upon 
Aule and his desire, because of his humility; and the 
Dwarves shrank from the hammer and wore afraid, and 
they bowed down their heads and begged for mercy. And 
the voice of lluvatar said to Aule: 'Thy offer I accepted even 
as it was made. Dost thou not see that these things have 
now a life of their own, and speak with their own voices? 
Else they would not have flinched from thy blow, nor from 
any command of thy will.' Then Aule cast down his hammer 
and was glad, and he gave thanks to lluvatar, saying: 'May 
Eru bless my work and amend it!' 

But lluvatar spoke again and said: 'Even as I gave 
being to the thoughts of the Ainur at the beginning of the 
World, so now I have taken up thy desire and given to it a 
place therein; but in no other way will I amend thy 
handiwork, and as thou hast made it, so shall it be. But I will 
not suffer this: that these should come before the Firstborn 
of my design, nor that thy impatience should be rewarded. 
They shall sleep now in the darkness under stone, and shall 
not come forth until the Firstborn have awakened upon 
Earth; and until that time thou and they shall wait, though 
long it seem. But when the time comes I will awaken them, 
and they shall be to thee as children; and often strife shall 
arise between thine and mine, the children of my adoption 
and the children of my choice.' 

Then Aule took the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves, and 
laid them to rest in far-sundered places; and he returned to 
Valinor, and waited while the long years lengthened. 

Since they were to come in the days of the power of 
Melkor, Aule made the Dwarves strong to endure. 
Therefore they are stone-hard, stubborn, fast in friendship 
and in enmity, and they suffer toil and hanger and hurt of 
body more hardily than all other speaking peoples; and they 
live long, far beyond the span of Men, yet not for ever. 
Aforetime it was held among the Elves in Middle-earth that 
dying the Dwarves returned to the earth and the stone of 
which they were made; yet that is not their own belief. For 
they say that Aule the Maker, whom they call Mahal, cares 
for them, and gathers them to Mandos in halls set apart; 



and that he declared to their Fathers of old that lluvatar will 
hallow them and give them a place among the Children in 
the End. Then their part shall be to serve Aule and to aid 
him in the remaking of Arda after the Last Battle. They say 
also that the Seven Fathers of the Dwarves return to live 
again in their own kin and to bear once more their ancient 
names: of whom Durin was the most renowned in after 
ages, father of that kindred most friendly to the Elves, 
whose mansions were at Khazad-dum. 





Now when Aule laboured in the making of the Dwarves 
he kept this work hidden from the other Valar; but at last he 
opened his mind to Yavanna and told her of all that had 
come to pass. Then Yavanna said to him: 'Em is merciful. 
Now I see that thy heart rejoiceth, as indeed it may; for thou 
hast received not only forgiveness but bounty. Yet because 
thou hiddest this thought from me until its achievement, thy 
children will have little love for the things of my love. They 
will love first the things made by their own hands, as doth 
their father. They will delve in the earth, and the things that 
grow and live upon the earth they will not heed. Many a tree 
shall feel the bite of their iron without pity.' 

But Aule answered: That shall also be true of the 
Children of lluvatar; for they will eat and they will build. And 
though the things of thy realm have worth in themselves, 
and would have worth if no Children were to come, yet Eru 
will give them dominion, and they shall use all that they find 
in Arda: though not, by the purpose of Eru, without respect 
or without gratitude.' 

'Not unless Melkor darken their hearts,' said Yavanna. 
And she was not appeased, but grieved in heart, fearing 
what might be done upon Middle-earth in days to come. 
Therefore she went before Manwe, and she did not betray 
the counsel of Aule, but she said: 'King of Arda, is it true, as 
Aule hath said to me, that the Children when they come 
shall have dominion over all the things of my labour, to do 
as they will therewith?' 

'It is true,' said Manwe. 'But why dost thou ask, for thou 
hadst no need of the teaching of Aule?' 

Then Yavanna was silent and looked into her own 
thought. And she answered: 'Because my heart is anxious, 
thinking of the days to come. All my works are dear to me. 


Is it not enough that Melkor should have marred so many? 
Shall nothing that I have devised be free from the dominion 
of others?' 

'If thou hadst thy will what wouldst thou reserve?' said 
Manwe. 'Of all thy realm what dost thou hold dearest?' 

'All have their worth,' said Yavanna, 'and each 
contributes to the worth of the others. But the kelvar can 
flee or defend themselves, whereas the olvar that grow 
cannot. And among these I hold trees dear. Long in the 
growing, swift shall they be in the felling, and unless they 
pay toll with fruit upon bough little mourned in their passing. 
So I see in my thought. Would that the trees might speak on 
behalf of all things that have roots, and punish those that 
wrong them!' 

'This is a strange thought,' said Manwe. 

'Yet it was in the Song,' said Yavanna. 'For while thou 
wert in the heavens and with Ulmo built the clouds and 
poured out the rains, I lifted up the branches of great trees 
to receive them, and some sang to lluvatar amid the wind 
and the rain.' 

Then Manwe sat silent, and the thought of Yavanna that 
she had put into his heart grew and unfolded; and it was 
beheld by lluvatar. Then it seemed to Manwe that the Song 
rose once more about him, and he heeded now many 
things therein that though he had heard them he had not 
heeded before. And at last the Vision was renewed, but it 
was not now remote, for he was himself within it, and yet he 
saw that all was upheld by the hand of lluvatar; and the hand 
entered in, and from it came forth many wonders that had 
until then been hidden from him in the hearts of the Ainur. 

Then Manwe awoke, and he went down to Yavanna 
upon Ezellohar, and he sat beside her beneath the Two 
Trees. And Manwe said: 'O Kementari, Eru hath spoken, 
saying: "Do then any of the Valar suppose that I did not 
hear all the Song, even the least sound of the least voice? 
Behold! When the Children awake, then the thought of 
Yavanna will awake also, and it will summon spirits from 
afar, and they will go among the kelvar and the olvar, and 
some will dwell therein, and be held in reverence, and their 
just anger shall be feared. For a time: while the Firstborn 
are in their power, and while the Secondborn are young." 
But dost them not now remember, Kementari, that thy 



thought sang not always alone? Did not thy thought and 
mine meet also, so that we took wing together like great 
birds that soar above the clouds? That also shall come to 
be by the heed of lluvatar, and before the Children awake 
there shall go forth with wings like the wind the Eagles of 
the Lords of the West.' 

Then Yavanna was glad, and she stood up, reaching 
her arms towards the heavens, and she said: 'High shall 
climb the trees of Kementari, that the Eagles of the King 
may house therein!' 

But Manwe rose also, and it seemed that he stood to 
such a height that his voice came down to Yavanna as from 
the paths of the winds. 

'Nay,' he said, 'only the trees of Aule will be tall enough. 
In the mountains the Eagles shall house, and hear the 
voices of those who call upon us. But in the forests shall 
walk the Shepherds of the Trees.' 

Then Manwe and Yavanna parted for that time, and 
Yavanna returned to Aule; and he was in his smithy, pouring 
molten metal into a mould. 'Em is bountiful,' she said. 'Now 
let thy children beware! For there shall walk a power in the 
forests whose wrath they will arouse at their peril.' 

'Nonetheless they will have need of wood,' said Aule, 
and he went on with his smith-work.
